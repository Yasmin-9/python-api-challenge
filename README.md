# python-api-challenge

Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

This challenge contains two parts: 

### 1. Part 1: Weather Challenge 

This section aims to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. We used the citipy Python libraryLinks, the OpenWeatherMap API, and problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities. This can be seen in the WeatherPy notebook.

### 2. Part 2: Vacation Challenge

We used weather data skills to plan future vacations. We used Jupyter Notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API. The code needed to import the required libraries and load the CSV file with the weather and coordinates data for each city created in Part 1 is provided to help us get started. This can be seen in the VacationPy notebook.
